# Data Types

{Awesome Works in Progress}

Data types are essential for categorizing information in statistics. They fall into two primary categories: **numerical (quantitative)** and **categorical (qualitative)**. Each has distinct characteristics and subtypes that are crucial for data analysis.

## Numerical (Quantitative) Data

Numerical data represents measurable quantities. It's subdivided into:

### Discrete Data

Discrete data is countable, often represented by integers. For example:

- Number of students in a classroom: `30`
- Total countries in a dataset: `195`

### Continuous Data

Continuous data can take any value within a range and includes:

#### Interval Data

Data with ordered numbers where differences are meaningful but there is no true zero. For example:

- Temperature in Celsius: `20°C, 21°C, 22°C, ...`
- Dates in a year: `January 1, January 2, January 3, ...`

#### Ratio Data

Interval data with a true zero, allowing for a full range of operations. Examples include:

- Weight: `70 kg, 80 kg, 90 kg, ...`
- Distance traveled: `0 km, 5 km, 10 km, ...`

## Categorical (Qualitative) Data

Categorical data reflects characteristics and can be sorted into categories.

### Nominal Data

Nominal data is for labeling without a quantitative value. Examples:

- Blood types: `A, B, AB, O`
- Types of cuisine: `Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Indian`

### Ordinal Data

Ordinal data has an order but not a uniform difference between categories. For instance:

- Survey responses: `Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree`
- Class levels: `Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior`

## Specialized Forms of Data

These are additional data types with specific attributes.

### Binary Data

Binary data has two possible values. Examples:

- Questionnaire with yes or no answers: `Yes (1), No (0)`
- Light switch status: `On (1), Off (0)`

### Interval Data

Interval data with meaningful order and consistent differences, but no true zero. For instance:

- Temperature scale in Fahrenheit: `32°F, 33°F, 34°F, ...`

### Ratio Data

Like interval data but with a true zero, making more operations possible. Examples:

- Money in a bank account: `$0, $100, $200, ...`
- Time taken to complete a task: `0 hours, 2 hours, 4 hours, ...`
