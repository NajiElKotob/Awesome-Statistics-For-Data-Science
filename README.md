## Numbers and Statistics
### Statistics Primer
* What is data?
* Data Types
  * Qualitative vs Quantitative
    * Discrete and Continuous
    * Nominal and Ordinal
  * _References_
    * [Types of Data & Measurement Scales: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval and Ratio](https://www.mymarketresearchmethods.com/types-of-data-nominal-ordinal-interval-ratio/) - mymarketresearchmethods.com
    * [Types of Variable](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/types-of-variable.php) - Laerd.com
* Population vs. Sample 
* Measures of Central Tendency
* Measures of Variability 
  * Range
  * Interquartile Range
  * Variance
  * Standard Deviation
    * Standard deviation (S) = square root of the variance
* Percentiles and Quartiles
  * Percentiles
    * The 30th percentile is the value from the data set greater than 30% of observations, and therefore less than 70% of observations. 
    * Median = 50th percentile
    * 1st Quartile = 25th percentile
    * 3rd Quartile = 75th percentile
  * [Quartiles](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quartiles.html) are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters - mathsisfun.com
    * Interquartile range =  3rd quartile - 1st quartile
    * Quintile - "A quintile is one of five values that divide a range of data into five equal parts, each being 1/5th (20 percent) of the range." [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quintile.asp)
    * Decile - Devide a range of data into ten equal parts, each being 1/10th (10 percent) of the range. 1st and 9th deciles equal to 10th and 90th percentiles.
* Binning
  * [Freedman–Diaconis rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%E2%80%93Diaconis_rule)
* Measures of Association
  * Correlation and Causation
    * [Correlation](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson) means there is a relationship or pattern between the values of two variables. A scatterplot displays data about two variables as a set of points in the xyxyx, y-plane and is a useful tool for determining if there is a correlation between the variables.
    * [Causation](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson) means that one event causes another event to occur. Causation can only be determined from an appropriately designed experiment. In such experiments, similar groups receive different treatments, and the outcomes of each group are studied. We can only conclude that a treatment causes an effect if the groups have noticeably different outcomes.
  * Correlation Coefficients 
  * Covariance

* Z-Scores
  * Simply put, a z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. But more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.
