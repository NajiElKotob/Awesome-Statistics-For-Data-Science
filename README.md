### Statistics Primer
* What is data?
* Data Types
  * Qualitative vs Quantitative
    * Discrete and Continuous
    * Nominal and Ordinal
  * References

* Population vs. Sample 
* Measures of Central Tendency 
* Measures of Variability 
  * Range, Interquartile Range, Variance and Standard Deviation
* Percentiles and Quartiles
  * Percentiles
    * The 30th percentile is the value from the data set greater than 30% of observations, and therefore less than 70% of observations. 
    * Median = 50th percentile
    * 1st Quartile = 25th percentile
    * 3rd Quartile = 75th percentile
  * [Quartiles](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quartiles.html) are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters - mathsisfun.com
    * Interquartile range =  3rd quartile - 1st quartile
    * Quintile - "A quintile is one of five values that divide a range of data into five equal parts, each being 1/5th (20 percent) of the range." [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quintile.asp)
    * Decile - Devide a range of data into ten equal parts, each being 1/10th (10 percent) of the range. 1st and 9th deciles equal to 10th and 90th percentiles.
* Binning
