## Numbers and Statistics
### Statistical Analysis
* What is data?
  * [What is Data](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1b/1b.1) - Data represent facts or something that has actually taken place, observed and measured.

* Measures of Central Tendency
  * [Numerical Summarization](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1b/1b.2) - stat.psu.edu
* Measures of Variability 
  * Range
  * Interquartile Range (IQR)
  * Variance
  * Standard Deviation
    * Standard deviation (S) = square root of the variance
    * The [empirical rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empirical-rule.asp), also referred to as the three-sigma rule or 68-95-99.7 rule, is a statistical rule which states that for a normal distribution, almost all observed data will fall within three standard deviations (denoted by σ) of the mean or average (denoted by µ).
* Percentiles and Quartiles
  * Percentiles
    * The 30th percentile is the value from the data set greater than 30% of observations, and therefore less than 70% of observations. 
    * Median = 50th percentile
    * 1st Quartile = 25th percentile
    * 3rd Quartile = 75th percentile
    * IQR = The difference between Q3 and Q1. IQR contains the middle 50% of data
  * [Quartiles](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quartiles.html) are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters - mathsisfun.com
    * Interquartile range =  3rd quartile - 1st quartile
    * Quintile - "A quintile is one of five values that divide a range of data into five equal parts, each being 1/5th (20 percent) of the range." [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quintile.asp)
    * Decile - Devide a range of data into ten equal parts, each being 1/10th (10 percent) of the range. 1st and 9th deciles equal to 10th and 90th percentiles.
  * Outliers
    * [Identifying outliers with the 1.5xIQR rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/box-whisker-plots/a/identifying-outliers-iqr-rule) - khanacademy.org

* Binning
  * [Freedman–Diaconis rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%E2%80%93Diaconis_rule)
* Measures of Association
  * Correlation and Causation
    * [Correlation vs Causation: Understand the Difference for Your Product](https://blog.amplitude.com/causation-correlation) - amplitude.com
    * [Correlation](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson) means there is a relationship or pattern between the values of two variables. A scatterplot displays data about two variables as a set of points in the xyxyx, y-plane and is a useful tool for determining if there is a correlation between the variables.
    * [Causation](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson) means that one event causes another event to occur. Causation can only be determined from an appropriately designed experiment. In such experiments, similar groups receive different treatments, and the outcomes of each group are studied. We can only conclude that a treatment causes an effect if the groups have noticeably different outcomes.
  * Correlation Coefficients

* Data Distribution
* Inferential Statistic
  * Null Hypothesis
    * The null hypothesis, H0 is the commonly accepted fact; it is the opposite of the alternate hypothesis. Researchers work to reject, nullify or disprove the null hypothesis. Researchers come up with an alternate hypothesis, one that they think explains a phenomenon, and then work to reject the null hypothesis.

  * t-test
  * z-test
    * Z-Scores
     * Simply put, a z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. But more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.

* Probability
  * Statistical significance ♟
    * Statistical significance refers to the claim that a result from data generated by testing or experimentation is not likely to occur randomly or by chance but is instead likely to be attributable to a specific cause [learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistical-significance.asp)

    * [P-Values, clearly explained (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z9OIYA8He8) - StatQuest
    * In general, P values larger than 0.01 should be reported to two decimal places, those between 0.01 and 0.001 to three decimal places; P values smaller than 0.001 should be reported as P<0.001. [learn more](https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/how-to-report-p-values-in-journals/)
    * A p-value less than 0.05 (typically ≤ 0.05) is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability the null is correct (and the results are random). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis. [learn more](https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html)
