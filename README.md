{Awesome Works in Progress}

## Let's Talk Data
* What is data?
  * [What is Data](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1b/1b.1) - Data represent facts or something that has actually taken place, observed and measured. 
    * Data > (beats) Opinion
* Data literacy
<br/> `Data literacy is the ability to read, work with, analyze and communicate with data.`

  * Power Analysis
* [Law Of Large Numbers (LLN)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawoflargenumbers.asp) - investopedia.com | The law of large numbers, in probability and statistics, states that as a sample size grows, its mean gets closer to the average of the whole population. 
* [Central Limit Theorem (CLT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central_limit_theorem.asp) - investopedia.com | In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of a sample variable approximates a normal distribution (i.e., a ‚Äúbell curve‚Äù) as the sample size becomes larger, assuming that all samples are identical in size, and regardless of the population's actual distribution shape.
* Confidence Intervals
  * [Confidence intervals explained](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/confidence-interval/) - scribbr.com
  * [Understanding Confidence Intervals :tv:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWsuO9f74o) - Dr Nic's Maths and Stats
  * The correct interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is that "we are 95% confident that the population parameter is between X and X." [Learn more](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat200/lesson/4/4.2/4.2.1)
  * Confidence Intervals estimate how close a sample mean is to the actual mean.
  * Critical Values (Z) 99%=2.575; 95%=1.960; 90%=1.645; 85%=1.440; 80%=1.282


#### Descriptive Statistics
`Describe, show or summarize data in a meaningful way`
* Measures of Central Tendency - are single values that attempt to describe the central position of a set of data.
  * Mean (Average) - Most meaningful with normally distributed data
    * Arithmetic Mean Œ£x/n, Geometric Mean n‚àö‚àèx, Harmonic Mean n/Œ£(1/x) 
    * The Greek letter Œº (mu) is used in statistics to represent the population mean of a distribution.
  * Median (The "middle" of a sorted list of numbers) - Diminish the effect of outliers (aka Med, M, xÃÉ 'x-tilde')
  * Mode (Most Often) - bi-modal distribution; categorical data
  * [Numerical Summarization](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1b/1b.2) - stat.psu.edu
  * Sensitivity to skewness
* Measures of Variability (Dispersion)
  * Range

  * Normal Distribution
    * The [empirical rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empirical-rule.asp), also referred to as the three-sigma rule or [68-95-99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule), is a statistical rule which states that for a normal (aka Gaussian or Gauss or Laplace‚ÄìGauss) distribution, almost all observed data will fall within three standard deviations (denoted by œÉ) of the mean or average (denoted by ¬µ).
    * [The quincunx (or Galton Board)](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quincunx.html) mathsisfun.com - | Simulator
  * Non-normal Distribution (Flat, Bi-modal, Parabolic)
  * Skewness (-ve Skewness/Skewed Left, +ve Skewness/Skewed Right)
    - When data are skewed right, the mean is larger than the median. 
    - When data are skewed left, the mean is smaller than the median.
  * Kurtosis (Leptokurtic, Mesokurtic, Platykurtic)
* Percentiles, Quartiles, Quintile and Decile
  * Percentiles
    * The 30th percentile is the value from the data set greater than 30% of observations, and therefore less than 70% of observations. 
    * Median = 50th percentile
    * 1st Quartile = 25th percentile
    * 3rd Quartile = 75th percentile
    * IQR = The difference between Q3 and Q1. IQR contains the middle 50% of data
  * [Quartiles](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quartiles.html) are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters - mathsisfun.com
    * Interquartile range =  3rd quartile - 1st quartile
    * Exclusive method vs inclusive method - The exclusive method excludes the median when identifying Q1 and Q3, while the inclusive method includes the median in identifying the quartiles.
  * Quintile - "A quintile is one of five values that divide a range of data into five equal parts, each being 1/5th (20 percent) of the range." [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quintile.asp)
  * Decile - Devide a range of data into ten equal parts, each being 1/10th (10 percent) of the range. 1st and 9th deciles equal to 10th and 90th percentiles.
  * Outliers

A scatterplot displays data about two variables as a set of points in the xyxyx, y-plane and is a useful tool for determining if there is a correlation between the variables.
    * [Causation](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson) means that one event causes another event to occur. Causation can only be determined from an appropriately designed experiment. In such experiments, similar groups receive different treatments, and the outcomes of each group are studied. We can only conclude that a treatment causes an effect if the groups have noticeably different outcomes.

#### Inferential Statistic
##### Hypothesis
* Hypothesis tests attempt to provide an answer to questions such as "How likely is an observation just random change?"
* Null Hypothesis
  * The null hypothesis, H0 is the commonly accepted fact; it is the opposite of the alternate hypothesis. Researchers work to reject, nullify or disprove the null hypothesis. Researchers come up with an alternate hypothesis, one that they think explains a phenomenon, and then work to reject the null hypothesis. [learn more](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/)
  * The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ‚â§ or ‚â•) Always write the alternative hypothesis, typically denoted with Ha or H1, using less than, greater than, or not equals symbols, i.e., (‚â†, >, or <) [learn more](https://opentextbc.ca/introstatopenstax/chapter/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/)

  * Which is more dangerous for a smoke detector? A type I (false positive) or type II error (false negative)? 
* t-test - compares the means of two groups
* Chi-Square test - determines whether categorical variables are associated
* z-test
  * Z-Scores
    * Simply put, a z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. But more technically it‚Äôs a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.

    * [P-Values, clearly explained (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z9OIYA8He8) - StatQuest
    * In general, P values larger than 0.01 should be reported to two decimal places, those between 0.01 and 0.001 to three decimal places; P values smaller than 0.001 should be reported as P<0.001. [learn more](https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/how-to-report-p-values-in-journals/)
    * A p-value less than 0.05 (typically ‚â§ 0.05) is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability the null is correct (and the results are random). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis. [learn more](https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html)
