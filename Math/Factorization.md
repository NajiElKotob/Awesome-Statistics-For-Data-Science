# Factorization
* Factorization, or factoring in mathematics, refers to the process of breaking down a number, polynomial, or mathematical expression into a product of its factors.
* Factors are numbers or expressions that can be multiplied together to get the original number or expression.
* For example, factorizing the number 15 results in 3 and 5, since \(3 * 5 = 15\).
* Similarly, factorizing the polynomial \(x^2 - 9\) yields \((x - 3)(x + 3)\), because \((x - 3)(x + 3)\) multiplies out to \(x^2 - 9\).
* Two numbers that we multiply together to get a certain product are called factor pairs.
* Every number has 1 as a factor.
* Every number has itself as a factor.
